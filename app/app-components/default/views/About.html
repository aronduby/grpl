			# About the Grand Rapids Pinball League

			The Grand Rapids Pinball League was started in November 2012 by Rodney Minch to provide an opportunity for individuals to play competitive pinball in a fun and friendly environment. The league is open to anyone who has an interest in playing pinball and all skill levels are welcome.

League nights are the 1st and 3rd Wednesday of each month at 7pm. League nights take place at Pyramid Scheme which is located at 68 Commerce Ave SW. Players are welcome and encouraged to come early and/or stay late to practice and socialize.
